# Crypt3xt: Lightweight and Highly Secure Symmetric Key Encryption Tool

Crypt3xt is an encryption tool designed to offer an exceptional level of security through the use of a defined symmetric key and a randomized local key. Crypt3xt achieves a mathematical remapping of data, resulting in an algorithm inspired by the ECM MK II encryption devices from the Second World War. This protocol takes the already impressive security of ECM MK II and elevates it further while porting it to modern devices.

## Key Principles and Innovations

1. **Symmetric Key Encryption:** Symmetric key encryption, is a proven method known for its efficiency in securing data.

2. **The Dual-Key Defense:** In addition to the fundamental symmetric key, Crypt3xt introduces an extra layer of safeguarding by incorporating a randomized local key. This dual-key approach fortifies the encryption process, enhancing its resilience against potential attacks by potentially allowing every message to have a second shared.

3. **Drawing Inspiration from ECM MK II:** ECM MK II, is a name synonymous with unbroken encryption and copytext expands its capability to larger keys. Instead of using rounds, the second key approach provides additional security.
